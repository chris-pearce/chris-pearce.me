<p>I <strong>love</strong> the craft of building quality User Interfaces and care deeply about the user experience, accessibility, and maintainability of everything I build, and this shows <a href="projects">in my work</a>.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m really passionate about working on internal design systems with other like minded peers where I get to build highly consumable, accessible, and robust User Interface components. A system that allows engineers to focus on the feature logic <em>not</em> the view logic and provides an organisation with consistent and accessible user experiences. Another passion of mine is CSS architecture and writing CSS at scale.</p>
<p>What else? I like to hang out with <a href="http://kllevin.com/" rel="external">Kate Levin</a> and try not to discuss our day jobs too much. Spend time with my daughter Matilda. Add to my trainer collection. Drink English Breakfast tea. Dream about owning a muscle car. And spend way too much time fussing over the details.</p>
