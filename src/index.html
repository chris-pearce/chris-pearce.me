<h1>Hello,</h1>
<p>I’m Chris Pearce, a Front end developer on the product team at <a href="http://campaignmonitor.com/" rel="external">Campaign Monitor</a>.</p>
<p>I <strong>love</strong> the craft of building quality User Interfaces and care deeply about the user experience, accessibility, and maintainability of everything I build.</p>
<p>I’m passionate about working on internal design systems with other like minded peers where I get to build highly consumable, accessible, and robust User Interface components. Other passions of mine are CSS architecture, accessibility and progressive enhancement, and getting better at JavaScript and React.</p>
<p>What else? I like to hang out with <a href="http://kllevin.com/" rel="external">Kate Levin</a> and try not to discuss our day jobs too much. Spend time with my daughter Matilda. Add to my trainer collection. Drink English Breakfast tea and <a href="http://whiterabbitbeer.com.au/" rel="external">White Rabbit</a> ales (separately). And spend way too much time fussing over the details.</p>
